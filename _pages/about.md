I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Physics at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://physics.utexas.edu) supervised by [Prof. Junyeong Ahn](https://www.quahntum.com). I am currently interested in theoretically studying the optical properties of quantum materials.

I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering at the [University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/ece) supervised by [Prof. Tony Low](https://tonylow.umn.edu). I used theoretical and computational methods to study nanophotonics in two-dimensional materials with a focus on surface polaritons. I also worked closely with [Prof. Eugene Mele](https://live-sas-physics.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/people/standing-faculty/eugene-mele) (UPenn) on topological plasmonic crystals.

Before starting my PhD, I was a researcher at the [IBS Center for Integrated Nanostructure Physics](https://cinap.ibs.re.kr/html/cinap_en/) in Suwon, South Korea. I worked on non-Hermitan metasurfaces and was advised by [Prof. Teun-Teun Kim](https://sites.google.com/site/teunteunkim/about).

I received my undergraduate degree in Physics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk). My thesis was on temporal shaping and characterization of laser pulses for quantum memories and was advised by [Prof. Ian Walmsley](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/leadership-and-strategy/provost/about-the-provost/) (now at Imperial College London) and [Dr. Benjamin Brecht](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/en/person/27150) (now at Paderborn University).
